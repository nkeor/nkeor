_Manners maketh man_

</div>

Hey there! I'm Namkhai B., alias forkbomb9 or f9.

I'm interested in everything from PCBs to webapps, although I mainly do firmware, sysadmin and CLI/TUI apps.

My main languages are Rust, Lua and TypeScript, each one for a different task. (I could include Bash in here but.. is it a language really?)

Rust for complex CLI/TUI and embedded firmware, Bash for light scripts, Lua for complex scripts, and TypeScript for web and one or two CLI apps that run on JSON APIs.

I use my GitHub account mainly to contribute to GitHub repos.

You may find my own projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/forkbomb9), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/forkbomb9) or [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~forkbomb9/) (not sure which one yet :P)

My contact info can be found over at my [website](https://forkbomb9.ch)
